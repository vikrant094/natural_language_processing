0,An ambitious drone delivery health service in Ghana is tackling key logistics challenges,Kwasi Gyamfi Asiedu,http://qz.com/africa/1604374/ziplines-drone-delivery-launches-in-ghana-with-vaccines/,"The Ghana Health Service is working with Zipline, the drone company best known for starting blood delivery services in Rwanda. Ghana’s health policymakers hope faster drop-offs will improve its health outcomes including reducing its maternal and infant mortality rates. According to the World Health Organization, “severe bleeding during delivery or after childbirth is the commonest cause of maternal mortality and contributes to around 34% of maternal deaths in Africa.” The timely access to safe blood could save many lives. The medical drone program was officially launched on Wednesday Apr. 24 by Ghana’s vice president Mahamudu Bawumia, who first made the announcement a year ago. The launch at Zipline’s Omenako center in Ghana (70 kilometers north of the capital, Accra) is the first of four centers it hopes to complete by the end of 2019.  The drones will be able to travel to 500 health facilities within an 80-kilometer-range from the Omenako center which is stocked with emergency medicines, vaccines, blood and blood products. The delivery program is also hoped will help reduce the incidence of wastage of medical products, a result of overstocking at hospitals. The company is targeting the “last mile delivery” challenge which many logistics operators face in African cities and rural area where road networks are either underdeveloped or poorly maintained. Zipline is describing the Ghana operation as the world’s largest drone delivery service. Ghana will become the base for training future Zipline flight operators as it hopes to expand to more countries in the coming years. There have been expressions of interest in a similar service from officials in Senegal and some states in Nigeria. Headquartered in San Francisco, Zipline, a for-profit company, was founded in 2014 and started operations in Rwanda in 2016 delivering blood and blood products during emergencies. It began delivering more health products including routine vaccines this year. Zipline claims it would be able to cover 2,000 health facilities that serve 12 million Ghanaians (of a population of just under 30 million)—from small community clinics and vaccination centers to larger general hospitals like Tafo – when all its four local centers become operational. The company has been contracted by the government of Ghana to make 600 deliveries a day (150 deliveries from each center) for four years and they will be paid per successful delivery. It would cost Ghana $12.5 million during the period.  Critics have argued the government should have rather spent the money on more important and simpler things the health sector really needs such as the critical shortage of hospital beds, gloves, consistent supply of water and the improvement of hospital buildings. And yet the challenge for Ghana and indeed many other African governments is the cost and potential speed of using drone delivery to supplement or aid health services is significantly more effective in the short to medium term when compared with the required scale of investment and time for both logistics and healthcare infrastructure. This is why for nurses like Gladys Tetteh, the use of drones are very much a case of what’s not to like?  “It makes us work faster and the mothers will not stay too long here trying to vaccinate their children.”",2019-04-27 11:12:30.022229
1,MTN will list on the Nigerian Stock Exchange—but not through an anticipated IPO,Yomi Kazeem,http://qz.com/africa/1603394/mtn-nigeria-ipo-telco-to-list-by-introduction/,"But as Quartz Africa has reported, MTN began rethinking plans to launch an IPO in Nigeria last October amid another high profile tussle with the Nigerian government, this time an allegation that it illegally repatriated $8.1 billion in profits and owed $2 billion in taxes. In an emailed statement to Quartz Africa at the time, MTN stated that prior to the dispute, “the plan was to meet this listing obligation by an initial public offering (IPO) on the Nigerian Stock Exchange” but that continuing with the listing by IPO “will make it challenging to get a fair valuation” given allegations by the government. Last December, the dispute was settled for $53 million. MTN’s listing by introduction is in contrast with its mobile money-based IPO in Ghana which saw the company raise around $237 million with over 100,000 Ghanaian nationals purchasing MTN shares using mobile money accounts. But despite its troubling history of billion-dollar fines and curtailed IPO plans, MTN is not showing any signs of slowing down in Nigeria as the company plans to launch a mobile money service in Africa’s largest economy this quarter.

2,How Nigerian universities can reverse their years of decline,Isaac Adebayo Adeyemi,http://qz.com/africa/1603479/nigerian-universities-need-to-reverse-years-of-decline/,"In the last 40 years government funding in the education sector in Nigeria has varied between 6% and 9% of the national budget. This is lower than most other African countries which range between 11% and 30%. This meagre allocation is also expected to fund the country’s higher education system. At independence about 60 years ago Nigeria had only two tertiary institutions. These were Yaba Higher College (founded in 1934), now Yaba College of Technology and the University of Ibadan,Ibadan was initially a College of the University of London, founded in 1948. After independence in 1960, all Nigeria’s states were determined to make education accessible at all levels. This, plus population growth led to a significant increase in the number of tertiary institutions. By 2018, Nigeria had 160 approved universities. These included 43 federal universities, 48 state universities and 79 private universities. In addition, there were 113 polytechnics and 47 monotechnics ,71 colleges of health technology, 153 innovation enterprise institutions, most of which are privately owned and 132 technical colleges. There were 82 colleges of education,consisting of 22 federal, 46 under the state’s care and 14 privately owned. It’s clear that the budget allocation can’t do justice to the needs of these institutions. If Nigeria is going to join the league of industrialized countries it needs to fund its education sector adequately. Most importantly, it needs to invest in solid infrastructure for teaching, research and national development. The main source of funding for Nigerian tertiary institutions has been annual budgetary allocations from the state and federal governments. To complement these allocations, the federal government established an education trust fund in 1993. This agency has been supporting government tertiary institutions under the Tertiary Education Trust Fund Act. This imposes a 2% education tax on the profits of Nigeria’s registered companies. The fund has played a significant role in promoting quality and education standards in Nigerian tertiary institutions. These funds have been used for: Fees and levies are another source of income. For government-owned institutions, the directive is not to charge tuition fees but to impose levies. The levies are approved by each governing council. This means that they vary from institution. Private institutions rely substantially on tuition fees and other levies. These also vary from institution to institution. They are also substantially higher than those charged in public institutions. Another source of revenue is internally generated income. Institutions are expected to generate additional income from grants, donations and other fund raising initiatives. But this has proved to be an uphill battle. Nigeria has a poor culture of donations because of the belief that the government is responsible for providing free education at all levels. The first major step to fixing Nigeria’s tertiary education problems would be to increase budgetary allocations to between 11% and 15%. I don’t believe that raising fees is a sensible road to take. Instead, the government should reintroduce scholarships, bursaries, grants and loan schemes, as was the case before the oil boom. Another shortfall in Nigeria’s higher education sector is a lack of research grants. The public and private sectors have to create an enabling environment and work together with the higher education sector to achieve the country’s development goals. This is the path taken by developed countries. Another major hurdle that will need to be cleared is relations with labour unions, in particular the Academic Staff Union of Universities. I also believe that private higher education institutions have a significant role to play in the delivery of quality education and national economic development. They have to be supported. While I was the chairman of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Registrars of Private Universities in Nigeria between 2014 to 2016, the committee proposed that private universities should also benefit from the Tertiary Education Trust Fund. This money would be used for staff development and research. Loans, at single digit interest rates, could be provided for infrastructural development. These recommendations were based on the belief that these institutions have the capacity to increase enrollment and cater for an increasing number of people seeking admission. This would also mean that thousands of students would no longer have to leave the country to pursue their studies elsewhere. Unfortunately, the law that lead to the establishment of the Tertiary Education Trust Fund doesn’t accommodate private institutions. This needs to be amended. It is apparent that Nigeria has failed to deliver quality education due to poor funding of the education sector and rising costs of education, among other factors. There must be a methodical approach to improving education funding for Nigeria to achieve the sustainable development goals. The funds must be used appropriately and there must be accountability across the board.

3,The fossils of Africa’s ‘big lion’ were hidden in a drawer in the Kenyan museum,Abdi Latif Dahir,http://qz.com/africa/1603323/big-lion-fossil-found-in-kenya-museum-drawer/,"In 2010, Ohio University paleontologist Nancy Stevens was working in Nairobi when she saw a chunk of rock containing massive teeth at the museum. In 2013, paleontologist Matthew Borths also found the same fossils in a cabinet that was part of a collection marked “hyenas.” Borths reached out to Stevens who confirmed she had come across the same. The creature’s jaw and other bones and teeth had been put there after being found at a site in western Kenya in the late 1970s. “It was like the two of us could commiserate, like, Isn’t this amazing, we should do something!” Borths told National Geographic. The two published their findings this month in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. Scientists hope the findings could help them understand more about hyaenodonts and other giant carnivorous predators. It also could help explain Simbakubwa’s eventual demise. Borths says the carnivores could have succumbed to dramatic climate change as intense wet and dry season precipitated the growth of grasslands about 10 million years ago and leading to the scarcity of prey including early elephants. In recent years, scientists and photographers have increasingly been capturing and surfacing interesting research about wildlife in Africa. In February, the “first high-quality camera trap photographs” of a black leopard in Africa were also captured in the Laikipia Wilderness Camp in central Kenya. In 2018, archaeologists unearthed Egyptian tombs and cat mummies dating thousands of years, some of them still in great conditions. Using laser lights, scientists last year discovered the remains of a southern African city that was occupied from the 15th century until about 200 years ago.",2019-04-27 11:12:30.022229
4,Scientists say we can’t be certain why Lake Chad is shrinking,"Frederi G. Viens, Michigan State University",http://qz.com/africa/1603258/scientists-arent-certain-climate-change-is-shrinking-lake-chad/,"This second study had a geopolitical angle: if the lake’s ills could be pinned on the forces of global change, international climate change negotiations would hold the promise of dozens of billions of dollars needed to build and maintain an inter-basin water transfer system, to bring waters from the Congo Basin into Lake Chad’s main tributary. This would be an economic boon for the region. But there was a problem. No study has ever looked at the link between global climate change and Lake Chad’s complex hydrology, nor at whether irrigation has any effect on lake levels. And, the evidence suggests that Lake Chad is not actually drying out. But it has seen dramatic variations—up and down, sometimes from one year to the next—since 1970. My own ongoing research on Lake Chad focuses on northeast Nigeria, home to around 25 million people: they are most vulnerable to the lake’s risk of severe droughts. Working with the hydrological data collected by Lemoalle and his team since the 1950s, I am trying figure out this risk, and to determine if it is linked to global climate change and local irrigation. My work involves statistics and data. By applying these within a particular framework, I can test whether these links are real. The framework I use is Bayesian statistics. It comes from an idea developed by English vicar Thomas Bayes in the 1700s. This approach calculates probabilities of unobserved events based on their relations to observations and on one’s beliefs about them. It took off about 20 years ago when computers became powerful enough to handle the massive computations involved. It is a form of supervised machine learning: The computer explores myriads of possibilities and evaluates them according to the underlying probability models. It then concentrates around the most relevant ones in view of the observed data. For example, we have bi-weekly lake-depth measurements on the Chadian side since 1956, and daily flow measurements for the lake’s two main tributaries. Lemoalle and his colleagues’ hydrological model relates these to the lake’s Nigerian side, which is not directly observed. But their model has major uncertainties. I use Bayesian statistics to calculate these uncertainties, give estimates of Nigerian lake levels, and relate them to rainfall data in the region. This work is performed with a team of undergraduate and Master’s students from Michigan State University, Purdue University in Indiana, and the Ecole Polytechnique in France. Here are our key preliminary findings, so far. Global climate change is unlikely to be the reason for the lake’s variations. Lake Chad’s levels do not relate to global average temperatures in any model my team has tested. It’s often said that you can get statistics to say anything you want. In this case, no matter how one tries to torture the data, it’s not budging. It won’t let us attribute Lake Chad’s variations to global change indicators. Irrigated agriculture, which is used by the millions of small-scale farmers in the regions around Lake Chad, does not seem to have any negative effect on the lake. The only substantial correlation we are finding is positive: a good rainfall year in Northeast Nigeria benefits the lake’s north side, and appears to benefit farmers living around 100 miles upstream. There is still a great deal of work to be done in understanding Lake Chad and its shifts. We plan to run predictive analytics to see if local population growth estimates may change our conclusions over the next decades, driving the lake’s resources into unsustainability. We also plan to partner with Nigerian academics to gather economic data and test an “ecosystem services” hypothesis which Lemoalle offered to me: while no one benefits from the lake’s north side drying out completely, a “small” Lake Chad is actually a good thing for fishermen, pastoralists and farmers. Incorrect beliefs about scientific facts propagate too easily. Breaking them is an uphill battle. My students and I will continue to use statistics and data science to dispel misinformation about Lake Chad. Frederi G.
