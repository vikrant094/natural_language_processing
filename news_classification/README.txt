Problem Statement: News Classification


Large volumes of news articles are received everyday from various sources. To simplify downstream processing tasks, one of the first steps is to properly categorise news into well defined categories. In this problem, you have been given a set of news articles and a set of categories. Your task is to develop a model which will be able to predict the category of unseen news.

Dataset
There are three files:
1. categories.csv - This file defines the different type of categories

2. news_details.xlsx - This file contains the news details like short snippet, title and description
3. category_mapping.xlsx - This file contains the mapping between news articles and categories

What Are We Expecting?


You are expected to develop a model to predict the categories of unseen news and summarise the following details:


- Preprocessing steps performed on the dataset

- Feature selection

- Different types of models tested

- Model Tuning techniques used to give best results

- Any other comments/experiment details
- Finally you are expected to select the best model and run your predictions on a cleaned smaller dataset (select a subset of shared news articles from news_details.xlsx) and report the performance of the model based on suitable evaluation metrics.



You are requested to submit 2 files:


- A Python file/IPython notebook containing all the training approaches that you tried. This file should also contain the relevant function for predicting on new samples.

- A Text file detailing all the above mentioned points. 

The code written should be properly formatted for better readability and appropriate comments should be added wherever necessary.
